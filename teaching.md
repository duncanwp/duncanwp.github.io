### 1st iMIRACLI summer school, Virtual, September 2020
 - I designed, organized and managed a two-week summer school for the 15 PhD students enrolled on the iMIRACLI Marie Curie ITN across Europe, as well as 8 other invited students.
 - I tailored the sessions to the student’s needs and arranged sessions covering fundamental atmospheric physics (by Profs. Nenes, Riipinen and Quass), climate change (Prof. Stier), modelling (Prof. Lohmann), data analysis (myself), deep learning (Profs. Rodrigues and Bamler) and causal inference (Prof. Runge).

### Big data analysis, Environmental Research DTP (Oxford University), September 2015 – Present
 - I co-develop and deliver this two-day course for the Oxford DTP in Environmental Research, including sections on data management, data fusion techniques, and climate data analysis on large clusters.

### Python for climate scientists, Oxford University, December 2016
 - *<https://github.com/duncanwp/python_for_climate_scientists/>* 
 - I organised, co-developed and delivered this three-day beginner-intermediate course aimed at introducing Python to climate scientists already familiar with another programming language. 
 - This was attended by nearly 40 researchers, covered everything from Python data structures through specific geo-spatial libraries to more advanced topics and received excellent feedback.

### CIS user-workshop, International, 2015 - 2017
 - I developed this one-day CIS beginners’ course and delivered it at the University of Oxford, the UK Met Office; Stockholm University; MetNo Oslo; and the UK Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements.

### Other:
 - Physics of the Atmosphere and Oceans October, 2016 – May 2017
 - Data Management, Interdisciplinary Bioscience DTP (Oxford University), 2014
 - Asking the right questions, Industry Focused Mathematical Modelling DTP (Oxford University), 2014
 - Mathematics Tutor, University of Manchester, January 2008 - June 2010
