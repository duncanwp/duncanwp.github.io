<p align="left">I'm an atmospheric physicist working at the interface of climate research
and machine learning. Having obtained a PhD in theoretical physics from the
University of Manchester I became a software consultant, providing bespoke
data analysis for researchers across industry and academia. Since moving back
into academia, I have applied these skills to investigate the effect of
anthropogenic aerosols on the climate. </p>

<p align="left">Using cutting-edge machine learning
techniques to combine global aerosol models with novel observational
constraints I look to better understand these effects and improve
projections of climate change. I'm also keen to foster the application
of machine learning to climate science questions more broadly and am Course
